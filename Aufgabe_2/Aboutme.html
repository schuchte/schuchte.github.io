    <th><p><strong>Hi Guys.</strong></p>
    <p>My name is Tanja Schuchter and I am 19 years old.</br>
        I live in Germany, more precisely in a small village near Waldshut- Tiengen.</br>
        It's pretty close to the border of Swizerland.</br></p>

       <p>After my graduation in 2018, I decided to make something meaningful.</br>
        So I started working in an aftercare clinic for children suffering from cancer.</br>
        And I realized soon that this decision was a life- enhancing one.</br>
        My life has been kind of enlightened.</br>
        To see the smiles of these kids was suddenly the most beautiful thing in the world.</br>
        It wasn't just a smile, it was a present.</br>
        A present which meant a lot to me.</br>
        And even though I firstly questioned that choice due to some self- doubt and mental pressure, I would never reverse this detemination.</br></p>
        <p>But coming back to the main issue, I have to mention further information about my person.</br></p>
        
        <p>I like to spend time with friends or family.</br>
        I prefer both, doing adventures togehter such as diving, or spending time on banalities like having dinner or watching a movie.</br>
        I am thankful for every moment we can share.</br></p>

        <p>Besides I enjoy to paint, draw, play guitar, listen to music, dance, play football or doing winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding.</br>
        And there is one hobby which turned into something very important to me:</p>
        <p><strong>POETRIE.</strong></p>
        <p>Composing Poems means to reflect yourself in a creative way, to express your thoughts, your feelings, your whole view of life.</br></p>
        It's kind of an individual fulfilment.</br>
        It's like Art consisting of words...</br>


    <p>Currently you saw my first Web- Portfolio, which is exactly about that kind of art.</br>
    I hope you enjoyed.</p>
    <p><strong>best regards, Tanja.</strong></p></th>
