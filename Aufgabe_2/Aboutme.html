   <p><strong>Hey Guys.</strong></p>
    <p>My name is Tanja Schuchter and I am 19 years old.
        I live in Germany, more precisely in a small village near Waldshut- Tiengen.
        It's pretty close to the border of Swizerland.</p>

       <p>After my graduation in 2018, I decided to make something meaningful.
        So I started working in an aftercare clinic for children suffering from cancer.
        And I realized soon that this decision was a life- enhancing one.
        My life has been kind of enlightened.
        To see the smiles of these kids was suddenly the most beautiful thing in the world.
        It wasn't just a smile, it was a present.
        A present which meant a lot to me.
        And even though I firstly questioned that choice due to some self- doubt and mental pressure, I would never reverse this detemination.</p>

        <hr>
       
        <p>Furthermore I like to spend time with friends or family.
        I prefer both, doing adventures togehter such as diving, or spending time on banalities like having dinner or watching a movie.
        I am thankful for every moment we can share.</p>

        <p>Besides I enjoy to paint, draw, play guitar, listen to music, dance, play football or doing winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding.
          <hr>

        And there is one hobby which turned into something very important to me:</p>
        <p><strong>POETRIE.</strong></p>
        <p>Composing Poems means to reflect yourself in a creative way, to express your thoughts, your feelings, your whole view of life.</p>
        It's kind of an individual fulfilment.
        It's like Art consisting of words...


    <p>Currently you saw my first Web- Portfolio, which is exactly about that kind of art.
    I hope you enjoyed.</p>
    <p><strong>best regards, Tanja.</strong></p>
